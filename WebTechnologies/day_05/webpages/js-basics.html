            Take this with a grain of salt : There is alot of built-in
            functionality in EVERY programming language you will study.
            The built-in functionality is to help provide you with a
            baseline to work with, and some common tools. One of the
            most common tools is known as a "Debugging statement".

            console.log() is our JS debugging statement.
