    This is a Bonus Practice problem for anyone who wishes get more practice with algorithms

    Create an algorithm that will check all numbers inside an array.
        If there are more odd numbers than even, print "This array looks quite ODD"
        If there are more even numbers than odd, print: "I don't EVEN know what to say"
        If there are the same number of even and odd numbers, print: "Balanced, as everything should be"

        Bonus 1: If there are any values in the array that are NOT numbers, print out how many of those values exist. This should ONLY print if a non-number value exists in the collection, if only numbers are present, this should not display.
        Bonus 2: Turn the algorithm into a function so that you can take in different values
        Bonus 3: Add an HTML page that will display the results in an element, instead of in the dev console
            Bonus 3.1: Add a section to the HTML page that will allow you to enter the array (you can separate the input for each element using commas and the split() function...look to the MDN documentation for more info)

    **If you attempt this bonus assignment, here are a few tips:
        -Talk through the logic (out loud is helpful)
        -If you need to keep track of information, use variables
        -Loops and if-else statements are your friends here...
            -Not all of your if-statements will be nested in your loop...
        -Create a test case to check your logic against (create some array with dummy values)
        -***Do not try to do everything in one go. Write some logic, and make sure that it works as intended, then add more. If you add too much code all at once, you will be more prone to making errors, AND your code will be harder to fix if a problem does exist***
