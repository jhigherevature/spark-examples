<!--
	File Pathing determines where a file is located on your computer. 
	
	You have two options when determining pathing. "Absolute" pathing and "Relative" pathing

	Absolute pathing establishes exactly where a referenced resource is located, regardless of the origin file's location.
	
	Relative pathing establishes where a resouce is located based on the origin file's current location. Typically Relative pathing is used in enterprise projects.

    <!-- Audio Files -->
    <h1>AUDIO</h1>
    <!-- The following example uses absolute pathing -->
    <audio src="C:/Users/JosephHighe/Desktop/Spark_Examples/WebTechnologies/DayThree/audio/notes.mp3" controls>
        <p>Audio file not supported!</p>
    </audio>

    <!-- The following example uses Relative Pathing 
		Note: the "../" in the relative path below indicate moving "out" of the current directory (folder)

        <source src="../audio/notes.mp3">
