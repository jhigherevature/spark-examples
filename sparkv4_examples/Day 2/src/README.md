# Objectives

1. Demonstrate basic Java project - how packages and classes are structured
2. Get candidate familiar with seeing examples in IDE compared to Replit

## Demonstrations
1. Once compile-time errors introduced, demonstrate a Hello World application through terminal. Explain compile step vs execution step. Create a syntactical error, like a missing semi-colon and try to compile. Explain compile-time error.

2. Create same demonstration in IDE and include at least one package and the Main class with the main method. Explain overall IDE structure and how running a program in IDE works.

3. Create same demonstration in Replit and include at least one package and the Main class with the main method. Explain how Replit project structure compares to IDE.
